WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
So with that top of mind, we're going to kick it

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.380
off with a couple of the top most interest topics with Tim,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.590
if you could tell us about. Share some thoughts about

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.370
artificial intelligence. As well as the cyber disclosure

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.670
rules that are new and the SEC, what we're seeing in comment

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.810
letters coming out of cyber disclosure incidences in form a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.340
case. Tim Brown: Yeah. Thanks very much, Ellen. That was

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.360
a great overview of really where the staff is headed with

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.290
their comments moving forward and things that companies need

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.280
to need to think about on every time they're making a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.990
filing. And as you said, let's dive into some of some of the

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.700
information here related to cyber security. So this isn't a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.130
webcast to talk about the cybersecurity rules. Hopefully,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.920
everyone at this point really has a good understanding of

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.270
what these entail. But just as a high level reminder of what

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.470
these rules required and where comments may be coming. We

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.410
wanted to share with the audience, just remember that

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.550
there's a new item 105 on Form 8K that requires disclosure

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.200
anytime a cybersecurity incident is deemed to be material by

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.650
a company and that Form 8K is required to be filed within

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.150
four days of that materiality determination. That is the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.140
four day clock does not start at the point in time where the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.860
cybersecurity incident happens. And so that's an important

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.800
distinction that we're going to get into a. Bit more here

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.390
into the details of in a second. In addition to that, the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.460
rules required certain periodic reporting disclosures to be

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.000
in annual filings of companies and those are more detailed

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.080
disclosures perhaps than were ever required before, although

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.210
certainly some of that information may have been in some

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.410
companies filings previously. There's some ability for

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.620
companies to. Claim an exemption to some of the disclosure

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.350
requirements, in particular case where there's a national

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.560
security interest that's implicated. Through that cyber

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.190
security incident. And so there are some exceptions there

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.750
that companies can take advantage of as well. So these are

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.170
very detailed rules. I'm sure every company out there right

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.910
now has put in processes and controls whereby if a cyber

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.970
security incident occurs or really I should say when a cyber

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.010
security incident occurs, because we know they're occurring

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.070
all the time, they're taking those incidents and they're

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.520
assessing them against materiality. In a cross functionally

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.060
way to really assess what that materiality looks like and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.710
make that determination. So if we move to our next slide

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.800
here, what we heard from Director Girding has been mentioned

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.840
a few times. He's the Director of the Division of

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.860
Corporation Finance. He made some statements this year in

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.230
May and they related to the use of that item 105 on the form

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.490
AK that I spoke about just a couple of minutes ago. And I'll

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.590
step back here to say that the division of Corporation

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.410
Finance for last few years is. Being clear in their

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.010
communications with the public to say that we're not here to

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.890
try and play a game of gotcha. Really what they're

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.910
interested to do is to see how practice has developed

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.220
through the application of the rules and the guidance that

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.980
they put out there. And then they're going to make comments

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.610
or make statements or put out CNDIS compliance and

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.630
disclosure interpretations to kind of address the way that

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.850
they feel practice has developed that they were not

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.480
intending to. And so this is one of those cases where.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.680
Director Gordon came out and made a statement to say we see

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.370
the companies are putting cyber security incidents on form

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.590
AK and using Item 105. Even prior to perhaps making that

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.340
materiality determination, there was really intended to be

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.740
the triggering event for item 105 disclosure. And so we feel

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.280
like that could be misleading for the investing public.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.400
Because the triggering event in our view, and this is the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.910
SEC speaking for item 105, should be that materiality

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.930
determination. And so if you have an incident that you've

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.130
deemed to be material, certainly put that on Item 105. If

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.670
it's clear at the outset from an incident that it's going to

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.700
have a material impact. And remember, the material impact

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.700
can either be from a quantitative threshold or it could be

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.300
considered qualitatively material to the business, including

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.420
things such as your operations. If it's clear from the

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.870
outset, then sure, go ahead and say that. Put that on Item

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.220
105 on Form 8K. However, if you have an incident and you

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.160
haven't yet made that determination. Or you've just

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.580
concluded it's immaterial. That's not necessarily bad

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.510
information for an investor to have. So we do appreciate the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.610
fact that companies are trying to disclose certain

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.600
information on form AK even before that materiality

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.990
determination has been made. In those cases, though, please

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.610
don't use item 105, Please use item 801. Or perhaps there's

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.000
another item within form AK where it may be appropriate to

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.900
make some of those disclosures and file those with the SEC.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.730
And so they really tried to focus the attention of entities

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.860
in these situations on that materiality determination. So

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.860
what have we seen? And I think we can demonstrate that as we

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.680
move forward here. What we've seen from the time prior to

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.980
May when the statement was made, as we'll see on the next

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.560
slide, and the time after May through towards the end of

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.130
September is really a shift. In the way that companies are

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.720
approaching these disclosures, so before May, we saw more

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.860
than half, half of companies using item 105 and either

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.310
saying it wasn't material, the incident wasn't material to

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.710
the company or they have not yet made a material

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.370
determination or perhaps being silent on some aspect of

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.020
materiality, but speaking to another aspect of immateriality

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.610
to the company. There was many companies making disclosures

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.200
on item 105 that said. There was no material impact and the

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.070
range in terms of when formaks were being filed was really

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.840
wide. So we saw any anything from one day after an incident

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.050
occurred which seemed very short for potentially an

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.900
immaterial incident where that materiality assessment has

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.640
not been made-up through say 43 days. And these are somewhat

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.300
limited populations. So the range was wide. Maybe it was

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.660
expected, but there was a varying use, I would say of the

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:48.000
form AK for these incidents. After Director Gerding made his

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.800
remarks, we've seen a shift and more companies are using 801

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.370
prior to determination of whether an incident is material or

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.430
not. We're seeing more companies being deliberate about

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.960
making comments in item one O 5 that an area was or an

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.990
incident was material to the entity for one reason or

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.280
another. And we've seen really a compression of that time

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.830
frame of reporting on form AK. From five days to 25 days

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.950
since that May statement came out. So I think everyone's

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.280
getting the message. We wanted to make sure that was clear.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.760
And that really leads us into our next slide where we have

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.740
some comments here that the SEC has issued on item 1:05. And

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.290
I think it's important to highlight here as you read through

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.480
them. And again, you'll have this information. You can sift

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.920
through the comments after the webcast. More closely, a lot

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.520
of these comments relate to that materiality assessment and

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.490
the SEC wanting companies to make sure that they are stating

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.210
whether or not. The incident of material, how it was

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.790
material to the company and providing information for the

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.620
investor know how that materiality assessment was made. And

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.990
that's not to say that detailed information that's going to

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.930
give away any secrets of the company is required to be put

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.560
on Form 8K, but they want the descriptions to match the

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.740
requirements that exist within the rules today.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.100
Additionally, we've seen comments where they're asking for a

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.430
better description about how that incident has or is

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.210
expected to. Back the business again, I don't think that

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.150
description needs to be in such a detailed way that it's

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.330
giving away private information from the company, but they

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.320
do expect the investor to know what those impacts are. So

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.170
this is really the SEC enforcing these rules and

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.500
regulations, as I said they would, based on what they

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.410
perceive to be the requirements and the information that's

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:41.880
being provided by companies.
