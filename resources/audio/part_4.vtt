00:00.000 --> 00:02.900
There are many opportunities to provide permissible

00:02.900 --> 00:07.820
tax and advisory services to AICPA and SEC audit clients,

00:07.820 --> 00:12.440
adding value to various aspects of the audit client’s organization.

00:12.440 --> 00:16.380
There are even more opportunities to provide tax and advisory services

00:16.380 --> 00:18.890
to non-audit affiliates of the audit client.

00:18.890 --> 00:23.525
These services, such as ESG IMPACT services, address client needs

00:23.525 --> 00:28.025
across all sectors, while still allowing the firm to uphold our

00:28.025 --> 00:30.995
independence commitments to the capital markets.

00:30.995 --> 00:33.695
We encourage audit professionals to refer to the

00:33.695 --> 00:36.410
“Focused Non-Audit Services for Audit Clients”

00:36.410 --> 00:39.850
document found on the Non-audit Services Portal when

00:39.850 --> 00:43.145
teaming with tax and advisory professionals to identify

00:43.145 --> 00:46.725
the many permissible non-audit services that we can provide.

00:46.725 --> 00:51.315
Doing so can improve the overall client experience by enhancing

00:51.315 --> 00:54.125
our breadth of knowledge of the client’s business,

00:54.125 --> 00:56.995
further fostering relationships with our clients and

00:56.995 --> 01:00.485
directly contributing to the firm’s growth strategy.

01:00.485 --> 01:02.995
Be mindful that there are still services that have

01:02.995 --> 01:06.820
to be carefully managed to avoid independence violations.

01:06.820 --> 01:09.145
The way to navigate through these opportunities is by

01:09.145 --> 01:13.415
relying on components of our System of Independence Quality Control,

01:13.415 --> 01:17.710
such as Sentinel. Following the firm’s System of Independence

01:17.710 --> 01:19.610
Quality Control when pursuing

01:19.610 --> 01:24.410
opportunities allows the firm to provide permissible services to audit clients

01:24.410 --> 01:30.225
and their affiliates. Throughout this course you will hear what you can do to maintain

01:30.225 --> 01:34.585
the firm’s independence when offering permissible non-audit services.

01:34.585 --> 01:39.210
For example, early teaming and consultation among non-audit professionals,

01:39.210 --> 01:43.550
audit partners and Risk Management - Independence, use of Sentinel, and

01:43.550 --> 01:46.940
the firm’s Independence Non-audit Services Portal.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.505
The portal was designed to centrally house

01:49.505 --> 01:52.421
independence guidance to use when proposing permissible

01:52.421 --> 01:55.955
non-audit services for audit clients and their affiliates.

01:55.955 --> 01:56.637
