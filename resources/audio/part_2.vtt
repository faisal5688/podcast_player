00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
The SEC requires all proposed audit and

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.990
permitted non-audit services provided to the audit client

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.990
and its subsidiaries to be pre-approved by the client’s

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.990
Audit Committee. There are additional PCAOB pre-approval

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.810
requirements for tax services and non-audit services related

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.870
to internal control over financial reporting. In addition to

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.520
requirements set by the SEC and the PCAOB, IESBA also

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.990
requires concurrence from the Audit Committee of any public

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.780
interest entity including our SEC audit clients, prior to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.960
providing non-audit services to upstream entities that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.990
control the audit client and downstream entities that the

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.990
audit client controls, regardless of whether the controlled

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.670
entity is consolidated.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.640
In order for the Audit Committee to make an informed

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.910
decision about a proposed service, the Lead Audit Engagement

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.370
Partner needs to provide them with sufficient information

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.640
about the services, to enable them to evaluate the potential

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.970
effects on our independence. Such information is obtained

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.990
from Sentinel requests and the draft engagement contracts

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.510
required to be attached to Sentinel requests for SEC audit

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.480
clients and their affiliates. That’s why it’s important that

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.810
details included within Sentinel requests are complete and

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.660
accurate and that we always stay within the bounds of our

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.400
pre-approved scope of services.
