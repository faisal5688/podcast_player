WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
So without further ado, we're going to head right

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.240
into some of the content today, and I'd love to welcome

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.620
Megan onto the screen here. And Megan, I understand that you

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.300
have some particular insights and experience from being at

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.140
the SEC with what the comment letter process looks like. So

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.910
would you be able to share with the audience kind of what

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.150
happens? And what they can expect going through the review

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.720
program. Meagan Van Orden: Absolutely. And like you said,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.080
we wanted to take this opportunity to remind folks about

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.170
that review process that the Division of Corporation Finance

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.710
or Court Finn goes through. So as part of the review

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.860
process, the division seeks to ensure that investors are

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.970
provided with material information in order to make informed

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.060
investment in voting decisions, both when a company

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.330
initially offers its securities to the public, but then on

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
an ongoing basis as it continues to give information to the

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.560
marketplace. Court Finn selectively reviews filings made

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.220
under the Securities Act of 1933 and also the Securities

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.650
Exchange Act of 1934 as required by Sarbanes-Oxley of 2002.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.770
The division undertakes some level of review for each

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.490
reporting company at least once every three years, and to be

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.040
honest, it reviews a significant number of companies more

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.970
frequently. In addition, this division selectively reviews

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.060
transactional filings and so there are three different

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.900
scopes of. That the corporate may perform a full cover to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.870
cover review, in which the staff will examine the entire

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.200
filing, a financial statement review in which the staff will

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.380
examine the financial statements and related disclosures,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.500
and a targeted issue review in which the staff will examine

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.600
a filing for one or more specific items of disclosure. And

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.020
as a result of the staff's review, regardless of the scope,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.110
they may provide a company with comments where the staff

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.990
believes it can significantly enhance its compliance with

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.920
the. Requirements. So through that comment letter process I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.310
mentioned, the staff may request that a company provide

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.090
supplemental information to help the staff better understand

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.020
the company's disclosures, revise the disclosures or provide

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.750
additional disclosures in a document that's on file with the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.800
SEC or provide additional or different disclosures in a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.850
future filing with the SEC. A company generally responds to

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.910
each comment in a letter to the staff and, if appropriate,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.440
amends its filings. A company's explanation or analysis of

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.010
an issue will often resolve a comment. However, that said,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.290
depending on the nature of the issue and the companies

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.370
response, the staff may issue additional comments following

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.300
its review of the companies response and related amendments.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.030
When a company has resolved all of the Division's comments

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.120
on a Securities Act registration, the company may ask the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.600
Commission to declare the registration statement effective.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.940
And when a company has resolved all of the division's

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.330
comments on an Exchange Act filing, the division provides

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.730
the company with a letter to confirm that its review has

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.850
been complete. And as Tim already mentioned, comment

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.510
letters and company responses are now made public on Edgar

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.350
20 business days after the filing review is completed. So

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.810
with this background, I think it's worth highlighting that

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.440
in fiscal year 2022, the division reported to having over

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.730
400 professionals, 70% of which were dedicated to disclosure

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.390
review. Director Gerding also reported that during the same

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.260
time frame, the division reviewed approximately 3300

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.060
companies as part of its annual. Program and if you tuned in

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.060
last year, and I hope you did, you'll remember we presented

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.730
specific metrics on the volume of comment letters in

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.180
previous calendar years. In terms of volume, as you see

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.270
staff comment letters issued to registrants in the calendar

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.190
year 2023 was consistent with the volume we saw in 2022.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.010
However, it's worth reminding you all that the number of

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.970
comments in 2022 was significantly higher than each of the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.890
previous four years. For context, there were roughly 3000

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.870
letters in 2023 calendar year. The number of registrants

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.330
receiving letters, however, has remained consistent with

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.930
last year, as well as the number of conversations or excuse

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.290
me, letters in the conversations. A conversation is a set of

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.260
letters from the SEC staff to a registrar and then from the

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.680
registrant back to the SEC staff with its response during a

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.400
single filing review process. The number of conversations in

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.070
2023 also remained consistent with 2022. And so now that

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.800
we've had a refresher on the filing review process, if we

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.590
move to the next slide, I want to take a moment to discuss

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.530
some reminders. When you're going through a comment review

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.010
process of your own or as you're drafting your disclosures

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.760
for the current year, the key things to remember are that

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.760
first comment letters and the initial letter are often just

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.670
the beginning of a conversation with the staff. Comment

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.570
letters are based on a registrant facts and circumstances.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.260
And the review of your disclosures should be dynamic.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.620
These reminders may be familiar to you, but they're worth

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.880
repeating. And so it's important, as I said, that you're

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.730
thinking about the SEC comment as the start of a

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.000
conversation with the staff. They may not and actually

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
likely don't have the same level of information that you do

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.360
about your company or a transaction. And frequently we see

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.350
comments that are just coming down to requesting more

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.200
information for an understanding to understand what's

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.250
happening. And sometimes the staff don't appreciate that the

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.330
information they're asking about may not be material. And so

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.450
it's important that you're communicating with the staff

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.550
about these items early in the communication process. Also,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.160
it's important during these initial steps to include all of

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.310
the related relevant parties when responding to the SEC

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.760
staff's comments. And that would include your SEC counsel,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.850
your external auditors and others within the financial

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.600
reporting and business processes, as this will ensure that

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.400
there's a fulsome initial response to the staff's comments.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.070
Next, as I mentioned, it's important to understand that

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.880
comments are facts and circumstances based. We see companies

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.030
frequently trying to compare themselves and their comments

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.490
to their peers and comments that may exist in the

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.570
marketplace, which is understandable. However, while it can

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.110
be helpful to compare yourself to your peers or what else

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.350
may be going on, it's often just as important to focus on

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.130
your entity and your specific facts and circumstances in

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.090
order to articulate your position to the. Half open and

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.900
honest dialogue with the staff early and often is the best

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.080
approach to dealing with comments that come your way.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.960
Lastly, I'll remind folks that the evaluation of the

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.920
relevance of your disclosures includes evaluating which

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.040
disclosures that you have made, but also which disclosures

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.100
that haven't been made. It's important to continuously

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.380
review your filings to make sure that you're removing

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.890
disclosures that are no longer relevant, but then including

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.750
new disclosures as information may become. Overtime, we do

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.150
see comments relating to things that may no longer be

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.630
relevant as well as comments about insufficient disclosure

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.990
or areas where disclosures can be enhanced in the SEC

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.920
staff's view.
