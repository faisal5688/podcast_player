00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
To provide reasonable assurance of

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.830
compliance with independence requirements, the firm’s System

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.920
of Quality Control around independence works to prevent and

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.980
detect independence violations.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.990
The effectiveness of our systems relies in large part on

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.490
receiving quality data from the audit client. Client

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.990
management may inform tax and advisory engagement teams who

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.400
are performing services for audit clients and their

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.520
affiliates of planned activities or transactions that may

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.990
result in new affiliates or affiliated persons, such as

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.700
persons in financial reporting oversight roles, being

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.640
identified. It’s important that tax and advisory

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.730
professionals are aware of their shared responsibility to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.480
also notify the audit team, so that the Sentinel family tree

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.960
can remain up to date, and any services provided to, or

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.680
relationships with, the new affiliates or affiliated persons

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.810
can be evaluated for permissibility.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.720
We also share in the responsibility to think about

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.990
Independence as soon as we’re made aware of opportunities.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.700
When potential opportunities arise, enter them into KPMG

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.850
Engage to start the appropriate engagement evaluation

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.560
processes as soon as possible.
