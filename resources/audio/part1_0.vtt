00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
If we travel back 20 years to 2004 rather than

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.250
being in 2024, we could actually not have this webcast

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.580
today. Now, I'm sure there are a lot of technological

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.790
reasons that statement is true, but more importantly,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.960
comment letters weren't made publicly available until 2005.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.580
For filings that were filed prior to August of 2004, sure,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.270
the SEC staff reviewed those and provided comments. But if

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.240
the general public wanted to see a comment letter. They had

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.350
to make a request through the Freedom of Information Act

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.530
today. Fortunately, we are in 2024 and we are going to take

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.980
advantage of all of those publicly available comment letters

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.800
to provide you with some insights and information about what

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.550
we're seeing with comment letter trends and hopefully what

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.190
company should be thinking about as they head into this

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.750
fiscal year end and into 2025 in general. My name is Timothy

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.600
Brown. I'm a partner in KPMG Department of Professional

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.220
practice. I lead our SEC Regulatory Matters topic team.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.170
And with that, let's introduce our speaker panel today. So

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.650
with us all from our national office here at KPMG, we have

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.200
Tim Phelps, Ellen Russo, Mamta Sony and Megan Van Orden. And

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.260
I really appreciate them joining us. And I think you're

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.750
going to really enjoy a lot of great content that we have

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.300
for you. And As for the agenda today, so First off, what

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.060
we thought we'd do is really level set the entire audience

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.990
on what happens within the SEC, within the review program,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.800
What does the comment letter process look like? And just a

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.550
reminder probably for most of you about how frequent. Lee

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.910
Companies filings are reviewed, the extent of the review and

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.420
things like that. Secondly, we're going to move on to some

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.240
of the priorities that the SEC staff has talked about during

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.600
the past year and those priorities that we see coming

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.960
forward into 2025 and beyond. So really what are those

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.660
critical matters that you need to be thinking about as

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.780
you're putting together your filings and your disclosures?

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.740
And lastly, we'll wrap up with a good portion of the webcast

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.740
talking about those comment letter trends, so. Where have we

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.800
seen those comment letters coming in? What are the comments

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.220
that the staff is making and how might that be impactful for

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.750
your company in particular?
