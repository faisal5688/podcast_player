00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
At KPMG, our vision is to be the Clear Choice,

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.999
which requires that our people are extraordinary,

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.433
that our clients see a difference in us,

5
00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:11.699
and that the public trusts us.

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.800
This means that we must be recognized for the

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.066
reputation we earn based on the integrity of

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.432
our people, and the quality of our work.

9
00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:24.033
Independence is critical to achieving our vision.

10
00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.166
Rigorously maintaining our independence has

11
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.766
always been fundamental to our values and

12
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.966
allows us to earn and maintain the trust of our

13
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.966
clients, our regulators, and the public at large.

14
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.299
Getting independence right has always been a

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.066
critical business imperative; you only have to look

16
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.566
at real-life examples to understand the financial

17
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.799
and reputational damage caused by an individual

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.466
or firm getting it wrong.

19
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.566
This training focuses on your personal

20
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.899
independence - investments, loans and other

21
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.333
financial matters. It provides you with the

22
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.499
fundamentals you need to know to fulfill your

23
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.700
professional and personal responsibilities,

24
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.966
and includes reference materials you can access

25
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:08.966
during and after you’ve completed the training.

26
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.599
Although there’s a lot to know, there are also

27
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.000
many people and resources available to answer

28
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
your questions and to help you do the right thing.

29
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.266
When in doubt, consult.

30
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:23.599
A critical aspect of being a KPMG professional

31
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.033
is keeping your knowledge up-to-date,

32
00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:27.799
so no matter how many times you may have

33
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.033
taken independence training in the past,

34
00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:32.566
you need to keep a fresh perspective on

35
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:35.599
how independence impacts you personally,

36
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.633
as well as how it impacts KPMG as a firm.

37
00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.566
Therefore, I’m asking all of you to take this training seriously and complete it diligently,

38
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:45.166
training seriously and complete it diligently,

39
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:48.332
knowing that although it’s just one small part,

40
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:51.699
it’s an important part that we all need to play in


41
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.500
in helping KPMG to become the Clear Choice.
