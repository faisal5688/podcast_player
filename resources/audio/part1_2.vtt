WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
And with these reminders in mind, let's switch

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.270
gears. As Tim mentioned, we're going to talk about some of

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.210
the SEC priorities that we saw from a disclosure review

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.170
program perspective. Ellen, I remember reading the statement

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.710
made by Director Girding earlier this year, and I was hoping

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.260
that you could. Share with us some of those takeaways from

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.790
the statement. Ellen Russo: Hi, everybody. Thank you,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.600
Megan. I'm happy to be here with you all today to share

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.960
insights about the Division of Corporation and Finance and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.350
where they're focusing their comments and their reviews so

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.260
that you can identify some areas where you might want to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.190
revisit your disclosures and maybe make some adjustments so

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.450
you can avoid comments in the upcoming filing season. So as

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.800
Megan mentioned, in June of 2024, Director Girding did issue

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.890
a statement about the importance of the. Disclosure review

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.480
program and top areas of comment and emerging areas of focus

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.570
for 20/23 as well as 2024 priorities for the division. And

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.600
we're going to touch on each of those today. So as we

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.800
move to the next slide, we first wanted to give a preview

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.520
about what to expect about comment letter topics. And as

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.360
you'll see for those who attended our presentation last

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.300
year, a lot of these themes are going to be this similar

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.640
they a lot of them. Haven't changed a lot of areas where the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.690
SEC is commenting are the same types of areas as last year.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.590
So there will you'll notice some common themes here.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.770
Director Girding did highlight emerging areas of focus of

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.670
2023 which are summarized here on this slide. Reading from

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.760
left to right, starting with market disruptions in the

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.240
banking industry which began as we all know in the spring of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.320
2023, the staff is reminding registrants to update their

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.480
disclosures related to interest rate risk and. Next,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.670
moving over to cyber security risks, which we're going to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.900
talk a good bit about today. Discussions related to impacts

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.260
of inflation, which maybe inflation is down a little bit.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.650
The Director is encouraging registrants to really update

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.070
their disclosures and focus on the entity specific risks and

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.270
impacts that are currently now in place, newly adopted

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.750
rules. We're going to discuss more on the next slide. And

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.350
continued monitoring of disclosures related for companies

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.590
with operations in the People's Republic of China. And

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.070
specifically, disclosures about material risks from

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.090
operations in that state as well as government interference

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.020
and maybe exercising excess control and disclosures related

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.530
to that in filings. And these topics are emerging from the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.880
2023 review season. We do expect to see continued focus in

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.690
2024 and we're going to dive more into each of these in

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.340
today's webcast. So moving to the next slide, Director

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.040
Girding also highlighted the priorities for the 2024 season.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.520
These aren't necessarily new topics. We have seen comments

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.150
on these things in recent years and there is some overlap

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.570
from the emerging areas of focus from 2023 that you'll

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.900
notice as the SEC is really continuing to focus on where

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.220
disclosures can be improved in these areas. So starting on

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.690
the left of the slide, we do expect the SEC as focused to

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.350
continue on judgmental topics and newly adopted standards

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.500
and rules such as segment reporting and. With ASU 20/23/07,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.230
which we're going to talk about today, compliance with non

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.260
gap rules and regulations and the critical accounting

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.070
estimate discussions in MDNA. And in addition to cyber

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.280
security that we've mentioned compliance with the new

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.810
clawback rules, the SPAC rules and pay versus performance. A

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.930
newer topic that we're going to be we're starting to see

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.320
noted at the top right of the slide is potential exposure

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.170
due to changes in the commercial real estate market from

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.860
interest. Exposure or high alone delinquencies and also

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.240
higher vacancy rates. And I skipped the bottom middle of the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.910
slide, but it really shouldn't come as any surprise to

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.870
anybody here on the call today. There will be a new focus in

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.860
artificial intelligence or AI and we're going to dive deeper

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.150
into all of these today.
