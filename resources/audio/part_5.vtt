WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
So as we move away from cyber and on to AI. As

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.690
Ellen was speaking about just a few minutes ago, there has

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.820
been an increased focus. On AI within the Commission of late

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.070
and I'd say, you know that's been within the last year to

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.940
two years. So what are we seeing there? Well, AI is more

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.940
pervasive and obviously most companies are adopting some

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.290
formulation of AI within their business model and more so

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.830
every day, right. So we are seeing a steady increase in the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.330
number of disclosures of AI trends within filings with the

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.510
SEC. Not only that, but we've seen a chair against her make

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.630
remarks about the importance of. Making appropriate

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.130
statements regarding AI. We've also seen the SEC Enforcement

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.830
division take actions against companies that are making

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.730
misleading statements about AI and their business in the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.210
public marketplace. So where are these trends being seen

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.060
within these filings? So if we move to the next slide, we

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.870
will see right now that the concentration probably not

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.040
unexpectedly of a comments within filings has been within

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.190
the description of the business and within risk factors.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.700
Really should not come as a shock to anybody. I don't think

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.200
that there's very few comments maybe throughout or

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.780
disclosure throughout the rest of the documents.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.160
However, we are seeing that the SEC review program is taking

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.350
notice and they are looking at statements that are being

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.140
made by companies. They're also looking at the disclosures

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.870
and to the extent that those disclosures are not descriptive

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.070
or do not provide a lot of information about. You know what

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.560
companies use of AI is or how it's impacting their entity?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.040
Or if they're claiming statements that maybe we are the best

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.370
the company with respect to AI in the world and those are

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.890
perhaps unfounded claims, we will see comments come through

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.540
from the staff on that. So if we move on to the next and my

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.870
final slide for this section. Once again, Director Gerding

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.070
had put out some comments in a statement earlier this year

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.360
about the use of AI. And one of the most important points I

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.100
can make here is that. The staff expects that a company is

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.130
going to describe what AI means to them and what kind of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.830
artificial intelligence are they using. Because

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.960
everyone's playing on a different playing field right now

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.290
with respect to a lot of this technology. Sometimes just a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.620
general use of the term AI is not descriptive enough for an

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.980
investor. So they're expecting that to come through. And

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.050
then some of the other things that I was talking about, and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.480
these are probably pervasive points that we're going to hear

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.090
throughout the rest of this webcast. So boilerplate

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.760
language, the use of buzzwords that really maybe don't mean

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.150
the same thing to everyone in the same way, these are things

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.700
that the SEC is going to comment on and ask companies to

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.370
provide. More robust disclosure about. So with that, I

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.660
think we can expect to see more in AI moving forward. But we

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.380
wanted to take a pause here in the middle of the broadcast

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.930
and see what comments we might have had, our questions

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.210
coming in from our audience right now. So I'm going to

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.230
invite Megan and Ellen back onto the screen. And maybe

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.260
Megan, I'll start with you. Are there any questions that you

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.360
think you might be able to answer at this point?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.510
Meagan Van Orden: Yes, I think one of the question that we received

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.720
was around. If I have been. If I think back to the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.530
three-year review rotation and I haven't received any

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.970
comments, does that mean there are no comments from the SEC

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.490
staff? And I kind of take that also to mean, does that mean

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.230
my accounting and my disclosures are what the staff are

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.830
expecting? And there I would say, yes, it could be that the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.560
staff has reviewed your filing on one or number of those

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.830
scopes I mentioned and they didn't have any comments at that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.450
point in time. But I wouldn't take non comment as a positive

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.570
statement that they in fact agree with your accounting or

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.760
your disclosures. It's just that at that point they didn't

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.280
think that there was comments to be issued that would

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.850
significantly enhance the disclosures at that point in time.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.520
And we'll get into this a little bit later, but that review

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.640
of your disclosures on a ongoing basis to continue to

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.630
enhance them. Tim Brown: That's great, Megan, really

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.930
appreciate that. Alan, is there, did you see any questions

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.930
that you might be able to answer? Ellen Russo: Yes, Tim,

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.280
I actually had a comment, a question on clawback because we

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.790
hadn't really touched on that other than reference to the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.460
new accounting standards and a question about what we've

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.950
seen for comment letters and clawback. And as everybody

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.310
knows, clawback is pretty new. Those rules went into effect

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.550
on December 1st. So the comment letters have been pretty

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.600
limited thus far, but they're really. On either missing

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.710
policy disclosures that need to be included in the filing or

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.400
also requesting information where there's been mention of a

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.520
correction of an error but no mention of clawback, There

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.880
have been some questions to just clarify that it wasn't

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.480
necessary to mention clawback. I will say we get a lot of

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.440
questions in the department about when to check tick box 1

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.670
and tick box 2. There's a lot of guidance out there on that

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.940
we're trying to work through and. Suggest companies also

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.870
work with their attorneys on those questions. Tim Brown:

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.720
Yeah, no, that's really great, Ellen. And I saw a couple of

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.410
questions look like at least two or three relating to what

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.350
does materiality mean in the context of a cyber security

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.670
incident. And when the cyber security rule came out, the SEC

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.570
chose not to change the definition of materiality in

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.640
connection with that rulemaking. And I know it's a broad

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.970
based definition and it was set by the Supreme Court a

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.210
number of years ago. And it relates to the total mix of

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.960
information that's available to an investor and what a

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.250
prudent investor might expect to have. Relating to their

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.420
investment decisions, and that's been a struggle, I will say

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.330
through kind of the adoption of these new cybersecurity

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.970
rules and the disclosures because every company needs to

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.060
make that assessment for themselves. What is significant to

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.300
one business may not be significant to another. And so

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.420
that's why, you know, we've stressed over the last couple of

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.940
years going through the adoption of these rules that it's

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.140
important to think about. From a cross functional

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.710
perspective, what does materiality mean to your business? So

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.800
that means getting accounting legal. Your cyber teams

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.280
together and others within the organization, some parts of

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.340
governance, you know those within your organization to make

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.400
those determinations in a meaningful way and through

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.250
processes and controls where you can make that determination

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.660
in a timely fashion to put out those formats when they're required.
